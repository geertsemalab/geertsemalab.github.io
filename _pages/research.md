# Research
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

Our main goal is to unravel the structure-function relationship of cytoskeletal proteins and protein networks in mammalian cells employing 3D super-resolution imaging. To this end, our lab has specialized in single-molecule localization microscopy, probe design and image analysis.

Specifically, we are aiming to adress questions on how cells adjust to stress stimuli, i.e. mechanical stress. Recently, the lamin family of cytoskeletal proteins have emerged as a key regulator of cellular response to intrinsic and environmental stimuli. Lamins are the main architectural proteins of the nucleus and form a fibrous, highly stable meshwork underlying the inner nuclear membrane. The cellâ€™s stress response triggers one of the lamin types, prelamin A, to accumulate, which affects important cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA-replication, chromatin remodeling and senescence. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how prelamin A build-up facilitate cellular dysfunction. Upon imaging the lamin networks and lamin-interacting proteins with molecular resolution, we provide insight on local lamin network distortions that enhance nuclear deformation and underlie cellular disease.
