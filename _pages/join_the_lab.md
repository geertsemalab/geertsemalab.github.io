# Join the lab
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

**This page is a work in progress. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out!**

We are a young and growing research group focused on uncovering the structure-function relationships of cytoskeletal proteins and protein networks in mammalian cells using cutting-edge 3D single-molecule localization microscopy. As part of our young team, your contributions will have a significant impact in shaping our research and advancing our understanding of cellular behavior in health and disease.

We are excited to welcome enthusiastic and motivated individuals who are passionate about scientific discovery. Joining our group offers you the chance to work at the forefront of innovation, whether in experimental lab work, data analysis, or simulations.

## Student projects

We are currently seeking Master’s and Bachelor’s students to join our team. If you're interested in using quantitative 3D super-resolution microscopy to study the nuclear lamina and interactions between cytoskeletal proteins, we’d love to hear from you! Our projects provide hands-on experience in experimental techniques, big data analysis, and simulation.

Below, we outline three main focus areas for projects in our lab. Many projects combine both wet lab (experimental) and dry lab (data analysis and simulation) work, so you’ll often work across themes. Projects are grouped by their primary focus to help you explore your options. We also encourage you to let us know which skills you’re most interested in developing. And if none of the example projects suit your interest, please contact us to discuss possible projects.

### Experimental work

What actors influence the lamin network? How can we image multiple protein targets with a single colour? If these questions pique your interest, then we have some interesting projects for you. These projects offer the chance to deepen your lab experience through hands-on work, complemented by data analysis. Current experimental projects include:
<ul>
    <li>Cell culture project on lamin network influences</li>
    <li>Setting up DNA-PAINT multiplexing</li>
</ul>

### Data analysis

How do you handle datasets of tens of terabytes? How do you extract quantitative information out of 3D point cloud data with millions of points? How does the organization of lamin AC and lamin B1 differ within the same cell? If you find some of these questions intriguing, we have already some large datasets ready to be mined. Depending on the duration of your project and your own interests, we will also learn you how to culture cells, and stain and image your own samples. Potential projects are:
<ul>
    <li>Quantifiying local organization of the nuclear lamina</li>
    <li>Deep learning to increase 3D SMLM throughput</li>
    <li>Machine learning for structural feature detection in 3D SMLM data</li>
</ul>

### Simulation

Simulations provide us with ground truth datasets to evaluate processing steps in 3D single-molecule localization microscopy data analysis. For these projects, you will create your own simulations and compare them to real-world datasets, and use the conclusions from your simulations to further improve our processing pipelines.

<ul>
    <li>Simulating registration of different targets in 3D SMLM data</li>
</ul>

If any of these projects interest you, please reach out to [Hylkje](mailto:h.j.geertsema@tudelft.nl).

## Job openings for postdocs and graduate students

At the moment, there are no open positions for postdocs or graduate students. However, we encourage you to check back for future openings.
